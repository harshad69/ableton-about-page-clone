08/06/2022 -- start date of this project. today I did the navbar for desktop .

09/06/2022 -- today I did navbar responsive, added hero image.

10/06/2022 -- today I completed 80% of the page.

11/06/2022 -- today I completed the project.

I got the idea from [frontend practise](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/ableton) to work on this project. I got to learn how the positon elements work, how the z-index work. In future I intend to make the 2nd navbar sticky.
